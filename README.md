# What is Blitz.js & How to Get Started With It

Blitz.js is a fullstack framework built on Next.js that lets you import server code directly into React components.

Here are the key features of Blitz:

- **Fullstack & Monolithic** <br/>
You only have one code base to develop and deploy. Everything from the backend to the frontend is done within this framework, and you don't need to assemble multiple layers across the stack to build your app.

- **APIs not required** <br/>
You can simply write functions that run on the server and import them directly in your React components in your frontend if needed.

- **Convention over configuration** <br/>
Configuration is optional. Everything from authentification to authorization is set up by default.
